{\bf (2008-2021) Trader/Senior Trader/Manager New England region, Exelon} 
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}
   {\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex} \setlength{\parsep}{1ex}}
   
  \item Lead a team of traders responsible for managing Exelon's New
    England portfolio which includes wholesale and retail loads,
    generation assets, and the Everett LNG terminal.  Coordinate
    portfolio strategy from deal origination through delivery.

  \item Directly responsible for the portfolio's basis risk, attrition
    and variable load risk, and ancillaries exposure.  Involved with
    budgeting, settlements, PnL realization and reporting,
    communication of regional results to management.

  \item Trade US power and gas products on ICE.  Trade TTF gas.  Trade
    FTRs and Incs/Decs for hedging/proprietary strategies in ISO New
    England and NYISO.  Trade capacity products, forward reserves in
    New England.
    
  \item Optimize the LNG supply to the Mystic power plant, manage the
    daily peaking gas options sold to local gas utilities and the
    power plant dispatch.

  \item Initiate and execute weather trades and load swaps to manage
    portfolio drawdowns.  Run MTM valuation and reporting for all
    Exelon's weather trades.

\end{list}

{\bf (2002-2008) Risk Management Group, Constellation Commodities Group} 
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}
   {\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex}
     \setlength{\parsep}{1ex}}
   
  \item Involved in many aspects of quantitative risk management.
    These include validation of existing models, development of
    independent models, and benchmarking of in-house models against
    third party models. Monitored VaR for the trading floor, deployed
    CVaR, suggest optimal trades to reduce VaR from a basket of
    instruments.
    
  \item Involved in the deal review process.  Contributed to
    identification of risks in new deals.  Built a temperature and
    load forecast model for independent valuation of load deals.    

  \item Developed a tool used by the Credit Group to calculate the
    maximum potential exposure.  The tool also calculates the margin
    requirements and the cost of credit by deal and counterparty.

able to deliver reproducible results to the larger organization
    
\vspace*{-4pt}
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}
   {\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex}
     \setlength{\parsep}{1ex}}
  \item Run a \href{https://www.mongodb.com/}{MongoDB} database for
    the New England group with ISO settlement data, load forecasts,
    ICE trades, and other ISO data useful for trading.  Run a
    \href{https://dart.dev/}{Dart} server to expose +100 webservice
    endpoints to the data.  Built +10 web applications that are used
    daily by my group and others in the organization.  Prototyped and
    presented a trade capture interface in
    \href{https://flutter.dev/}{Flutter}.

  \item R package contributor (package
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xlsx/index.html}{xlsx}).
    Wrote +10,000 R functions including several Exelon internal
    packages for analytics and reporting.  Used Java to connect R to
    Interactive Brokers.
