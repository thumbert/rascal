\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces VLR as a function of price when prices are a deterministic function of load. Hard to see in the figure, but the linear model is a quadratic, with the second zero at the tarrif price of \$70/MWh. The prices for the linear model shown as points, correspond to 1000 values of load ${\cal  N}(600,30)$ by the linear transformation $P=0.04*L + 4$. The quadratic tail model (blue) has prices equal $P = 0.04L + 4 + 0.02*\mathrm  {max}(L-L_*,0)(L-L_*)^2$ with $L_*=665$. The vertex price for the linear model is $P_*=49$, half way between $E[P]$ and tariff $T$.}}{4}}
