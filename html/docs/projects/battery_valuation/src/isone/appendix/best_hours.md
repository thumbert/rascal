# Best hours for charging and discharging

What have been historically the best hours to charge and discharge a battery in New England?  Have these hour blocks change over time?  For example, while historically the best time to charge was in the very early overnight hours, changes in the stack and significant BTM solar installations in the future may shift the best time to charge to the middle of the day.    

The table below tries to answer these questions by looking at the recent historical data.  Each calendar year is split into month groups of 'similar' months.  The month groups are: 'Dec-Feb' (a winter group), 'Mar-May' (a spring group), 'Jun-Sep' (a summer group), and 'Oct-Nov' (a fall group).  While these groupings may seem arbitrary, they try to capture similar weather, solar, and market dynamics.

Given the data in the table, the best choices have been 
* 'Dec-Feb' group starts charging at 1 AM, discharging at 4 PM
* 'Mar-May' group starts charging at 1 AM, discharging at 6 PM  
* 'Jun-Sep' group starts charging at 2 AM, discharging at 6 PM
* 'Oct-Nov' group starts charging at 1 AM, discharging at 5 PM

> In recent years, starting to charge in the middle of the day, 
> at 11 AM or 12 PM becomes an option, especially in the 'Mar-May' 
> spring season.
